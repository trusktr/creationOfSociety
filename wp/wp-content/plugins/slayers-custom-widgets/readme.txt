= Instead of writing a longer description here's what others say: =

* "Wow amazing plugin, I have been needing this in a long time... first step to remove the recent posts from front page but put them on the rest... thanks!"

* "Currently writing a review of the plugin for Performancing.com and I get psyched up while writing it. With this plugin, you practically added the functionality to WordPress that Joomla has had for quite some time with regards to module assignments. Instead of modules in WordPress, people can assign Widgets. This is great."

* "I’ve read whole post and I’m amazed. It seems to be one of most powerful plugin for Wordpress. Thank you for great share."

* "Installed fine and added the features I was looking for. This really help make my sited do what I want them to do."

* "I love the granularity this plugin provides. I use the Mandigo theme, which allows you to turn off widgets on content pages. But being able to put related posts & categories on a content page would be ideal."

2 Managing your widgets

* Go to the TS Custom Widgets tab. Those Widget titles which have the blue color weren’t added to any pages/posts/tags/categories. Those which are red were already added to a section(this was implemented in order to make a difference between widgets in use and  widgets not modded by my plugin.
