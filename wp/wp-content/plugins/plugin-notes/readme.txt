Allows you to add notes to plugins.

== Description ==

Allows you to add notes to plugins. Useful when you're using lots of plugins and/or make modifications to a plugin and want to make a note of them, and/or work on your WordPress install with a group of people. This plugin was inspired by a post by [Chris Coyier](http://digwp.com): (http://digwp.com/2009/10/ideas-for-plugins/)

Note: the plugin requires PHP5+
